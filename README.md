# 12th STD - Themes in Indian History

## 1. Topic - Bricks, Bread and Bones (The Harappan Civilisation)

- The Harappan seal is possibly the most distinctive artifact of the Harappan or Indus Valley Civilisation. It was made of a stone called Steatite.
- Seals like this one contain animal motifs and signs from a script that remains undeciphered.
- Yet we know a great deal about the lives of the people who lived in the region from what they left behind - their houses, pots, ornaments, tools, and seals - in other words, from archeological evidence.

# **Terms, Places, Times**
- The Indus Valley Civilisation is also called the Harappan Culture. 
- Archeologists use the term "Culture" for a group of objects, distinctive in style, usually found together within a specific geographical area and period of time.
- In the case of Harappan culture, these distinctive objects include seals, heads, weights, stone blades, and even baked bricks.
- These objects were found in areas as far apart as Afghanistan, Jammu, Baluchistan (Pakistan) and Gujarat.
- Named after Harappa, the first site where this unique culture was discovered, the civilization is dated between 2600 and 1900 BCE.
- There were earlier and later cultures, often called Early Harappan and Late Harappan, in the same area.
- The Harappan Civilisation is sometimes called the Mature Harappan culture to distinguish it from these cultures.

# **Only Important**
- There were several archeological cultures in the region prior to the Mature Harappan. These cultures were associated with distinctive pottery, evidence of agriculture and pastoralism, and some crafts.
- Settlements were generally small, and there were virtually no large buildings.
- It appears that there was a break between the Early Harappan and the Harappan Civilisation, evident from large-scale burning at some sites, as well as the abandonment of certain settlements.

- Harappans ate a wide range of plant and animal products, including fish. Bones of fish and fowl are found.
- Archeologists have been able to reconstruct dietary practices from finds of charred grains and seeds.
  - Grains found at Harappan sites include wheat, barley, lentil, chickpea, and sesame.
  - Millets are found at sites in Gujarat.
  - Rice is rare.
  - Animal bones found at Harappan sites include those of cattle, sheep, goats, buffalo, and pigs.
  - Studies done by Archeologists or zoo archeologists indicate that these animals were domesticated.
  - Bones of wild species such as boar, deer, and gharial are also found.
  - Not know whether the Harappans hunted these animals themselves or obtained meat from other hunting communities.
