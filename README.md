# 12th STD - Themes in Indian History

## 1. Topic - Bricks, Bread and Bones (The Harappan Civilisation)

- The Harappan seal is possibly the most distinctive artifact of the Harappan or Indus Valley Civilisation. It was made of a stone called Steatite.
- Seals like this one contain animal motifs and signs from a script that remains undeciphered.
- Yet we know a great deal about the lives of the people who lived in the region from what they left behind - their houses, pots, ornaments, tools, and seals - in other words, from archeological evidence.

# **Terms, Places, Times**
- The Indus Valley Civilisation is also called the Harappan Culture. 
- Archeologists use the term "Culture" for a group of objects, distinctive in style, usually found together within a specific geographical area and period of time.
- In the case of Harappan culture, these distinctive objects include seals, heads, weights, stone blades, and even baked bricks.
- These objects were found in areas as far apart as Afghanistan, Jammu, Baluchistan (Pakistan) and Gujarat.
- Named after Harappa, the first site where this unique culture was discovered, the civilization is dated between 2600 and 1900 BCE.
- There were earlier and later cultures, often called Early Harappan and Late Harappan, in the same area.
- The Harappan Civilisation is sometimes called the Mature Harappan culture to distinguish it from these cultures.

# Important abbreviations
- **BP** stands for **Before Present**
- **BCE** stands for **Before Common Era**
- **CE** stands for **Common Era**

# Settlements of Early and Mature Harappan Cultures
**Sind and Cholistan** (The desert area of Pakistan bordering the Thar Desert.)

# **Only Important**
- There were several archeological cultures in the region prior to the Mature Harappan. These cultures were associated with distinctive pottery, evidence of agriculture and pastoralism, and some crafts.
- Settlements were generally small, and there were virtually no large buildings.
- It appears that there was a break between the Early Harappan and the Harappan Civilisation, evident from large-scale burning at some sites, as well as the abandonment of certain settlements.

 - Harappans ate a wide range of plant and animal products, including fish. Bones of fish and fowl are found.
 - Archeologists have been able to reconstruct dietary practices from finds of charred grains and seeds.
  - Grains found at Harappan sites include wheat, barley, lentil, chickpea, and sesame.
  - Millets are found at sites in Gujarat.
  - Rice is rare.
  - Animal bones found at Harappan sites include those of cattle, sheep, goats, buffalo, and pigs.
  - Studies done by Archeologists or zoo archeologists indicate that these animals were domesticated.
  - Bones of wild species such as boar, deer, and gharial are also found.
  - Not know whether the Harappans hunted these animals themselves or obtained meat from other hunting communities. 

# Agricultural Technologies
- While the prevalence of agriculture is indicated by finds of gains.
- Representation of seals and terracotta sculpture indicate that bull was known and archeologists extrapolate from this that oxen were used for ploughing.
- Terracotta models of the plough have been found at sites in Cholistan and at Banawali (Haryana).
- Archeologists have also found evidence of a ploughed field at Kalibangan (Rajasthan), associated with early Harappan levels.
- The field had two sets of furrows at right angles to each other, suggesting that two different crops were grown together.
- Archeologists have also tried to identify the tools used for harvesting.

# Did the harappans use stone blades set in wooden handles or did they use metal tools?
The Harappan civilization, also known as the Indus Valley Civilization, used both stone tools and metal tools. Archaeological evidence suggests that they employed a variety of stone tools, including stone blades that were likely set in wooden handles. These stone tools were made from materials such as chert and were used for various purposes, including cutting, scraping, and hunting.

In addition to stone tools, the Harappans also used metal tools. They had access to metals like copper and bronze, which they used to create a range of tools and implements. The use of metal tools indicates a relatively advanced level of metallurgical knowledge and technology for their time.

Overall, the Harappan civilization utilized a combination of stone and metal tools to meet their daily needs and to support their sophisticated urban centers.

- Most Harappan sites are located in semi-arid lands, where irrigation was probably required for agriculture.
- Traces of canals have been found at the Harappan site of Shortughai in Afghanistan. Not in Punjab or Sind.
- It is possible that ancient canals silted up long ago.
- It is likely that water drawn from wells was used for irrigation.
- Besides, water reservoir found in Dholavira (Gujarat) may have been used to store water for agriculture.

# What is the evidence used by archeologists to reconstruct dietary practices?
Archaeologists use a variety of evidence to reconstruct the dietary practices of ancient populations, including the following:

1. **Faunal Remains**: Bones, teeth, and shells of animals found at archaeological sites can indicate what types of animals were consumed. Analysis of cut marks, burn marks, and butchery patterns can provide insights into hunting, processing, and cooking practices.

2. **Botanical Remains**: Plant remains such as seeds, nuts, fruits, and grains are often preserved at archaeological sites. These can be recovered through techniques like flotation, where soil samples are agitated in water to separate lighter plant remains from heavier sediments. Pollen analysis and phytolith studies can also provide information on the types of plants that were present and potentially consumed.

3. **Human Remains**: Analysis of human bones and teeth can reveal dietary information through isotopic analysis. For example, stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen in bone collagen can provide insights into the types of plants and animals consumed. Dental wear and the presence of cavities can also give clues about diet.

4. **Residue Analysis**: Chemical analysis of residues found on pottery, tools, or other artifacts can identify traces of foodstuffs that were processed, stored, or cooked. Techniques such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) can detect specific compounds related to different types of food.

5. **Coprolites**: Fossilized human or animal feces, known as coprolites, can provide direct evidence of diet. Analysis of coprolites can reveal undigested food remains, such as seeds, bones, and plant fibers, as well as parasites that might have been present in the food or water supply.

6. **Artifacts**: Tools and artifacts associated with food processing, such as grinding stones, mortars and pestles, and cooking vessels, can offer clues about dietary practices. Wear patterns on these tools can indicate how they were used.

7. **Iconography and Written Records**: In some cases, depictions of food, feasting scenes, or agricultural activities in art, as well as written records such as inscriptions or texts, can provide information about what people ate and how they prepared their food.

8. **Environmental Data**: Reconstruction of ancient environments through pollen analysis, sediment cores, and other paleoenvironmental techniques can provide context for understanding what types of food resources were available in the area.

By combining these various lines of evidence, archaeologists can build a comprehensive picture of the dietary practices of ancient populations.

# Mohenjodaro A planned urban center
- The most unique feature of the Harappan civilization was the development of Urban centers.
- Mohenjodaro is the most well-known site. The first site to be discovered was Harappa.
- The settlement is divided into two sections, one smaller but higher and the other much larger but lower.
- Archeologists designate these as the Citadel and the lower town respectively.
- Citadel buildings were constructed on mud brick platforms. It was walled and it means that it was separated from the Lower Town.
- The Lower Town was also walled.
- Settlement was first planned and then implemented accordingly. It was a planned city.

# Laying out drains
- One of the most distinctive features of Harappan cities was the carefully planned drainage system.
- If we look at the Lower Town, roads and streets were laid out along an approximate grid pattern, intersecting at right angles.
- It seems that streets with drains were laid out first and then houses built along them.
- If domestic waste water had to flow into the street drains, every house needed to have at least one wall along a street.

# Citadels
Citadels in Harappan settlements are significant for several reasons, particularly in the context of understanding the urban planning, social organization, and governance of the Indus Valley Civilization. Here are the key points regarding citadels in Harappan settlements, along with their importance:

### 4. Compare the citadels of Harappan cities with similar structures in other ancient civilizations.

**Answer:**

Comparing the citadels of Harappan cities with similar structures in other ancient civilizations reveals both similarities and differences in their functions and significance:

- **Mesopotamian Ziggurats**:
  - **Similarity**: Both citadels and ziggurats were elevated structures that played important roles in their respective cities. They served as centers of administration, religious activities, and storage.
  - **Difference**: Ziggurats were primarily religious structures dedicated to gods, while Harappan citadels had a more multifunctional role, including administrative, economic, and possibly religious functions.

- **Egyptian Pyramids**:
  - **Similarity**: Both served as prominent landmarks within their cities and reflected the architectural and engineering prowess of their builders.
  - **Difference**: Egyptian pyramids were primarily tombs for pharaohs, emphasizing their religious and funerary significance. In contrast, Harappan citadels were more functional, serving as administrative centers and storage facilities.

- **Aegean Palaces (e.g., Minoan Palaces in Crete)**:
  - **Similarity**: Both the citadels and Aegean palaces served as administrative and economic centers, housing storage facilities and workshops.
  - **Difference**: Aegean palaces were also residential complexes for the ruling elite, whereas Harappan citadels' residential function is less clear, with more emphasis on their administrative and storage roles.

In summary, while citadels in Harappan cities shared some common features with similar structures in other ancient civilizations, they were distinct in their multifunctional roles, combining administrative, economic, and possibly religious functions in a single complex.

# The Plight of Harappa
- Harappa was the first site to be discovered.
- It was badly destroyed by the brick robbers.
- As early as 1875, Alexander Cunningham, the first director-general of the Archeological Survey of India (ASI), often called the father of Indian archeology.
- The amount of brick taken from the ancient site was enough to lay bricks for "about 100 miles".
- Mohenjodaro was far better preserved.

# Domestic architecture
- The Lower Town at Mohenjodaro provides examples of residential buildings. 
- Many were centered on a courtyard, with rooms on all sides.
- The courtyard was probably the center of activities such as cooking and weaving, particularly during hot and dry weather.
- What is also interesting was privacy. There are no windows in the walls along the ground level. The main enterance does not give a direct view of the interior or the courtyard.
- Every house had its own bathroom paved with bricks, with drains connected through the wall to the street drains.
- Some houses have remains of staircases to reach a second storey or the roof.
- Many houses had wells, often in a room that could be reached from the outside and perhaps used by passers-by.
- Number of wells in Mohenjodaro was about 700.
- Drainage systems were not unique to the larger cities, but were found in smaller settlements as well.
- At Lothal - While houses were built of mud bricks, drains were made of burnt bricks.

# The Citadel
- It is on the citadel we find evidence of Warehouses and the Great Bath.
- The great bath was large rectangular tank in a courtyard surrounded by a corridor on all four sides.
- There were two flights of steps on the north and south leading into the tank, which was made watertight by setting bricks on edge and using a mortar of gypsum.
- There were rooms on three sides, in one of which was a large well.
- Water from the tank flowed into a huge drain.
- Across a lane to the north lay a smaller building with eight bathrooms, four on each side of the corridor, with drains from each bathroom connecting to a drain that ran along the corridor.
- The uniqueness of the structure, as well as the context in which it was found (the citadel, with several distinctive buildings), has led scholars to suggest that it was meant for some kind of a special ritual bath.

## Which of the architectural features of Mohenjodaro indicate Planning?
The architectural features of Mohenjo-Daro that indicate advanced urban planning include the following:

### Grid Layout
- **Street Design**: The city was laid out in a grid pattern with streets running north-south and east-west, intersecting at right angles. This systematic street layout suggests careful planning.
- **Uniformity**: The uniform width of streets and the standardized size of bricks used in construction reflect a high degree of standardization and planning.

### Drainage System
- **Advanced Drainage**: Mohenjo-Daro had an extensive and sophisticated drainage system. Covered drains ran along the streets, connected to household drains, and included manholes for maintenance, indicating a planned approach to waste and water management.
- **Public Baths**: The presence of the Great Bath, a large public bathing area with an efficient drainage system, points to advanced urban infrastructure planning.

### Residential Buildings
- **Standardized Houses**: Residential buildings followed standardized plans with similar layouts, including courtyards and multiple rooms, suggesting uniformity in planning.
- **Private Wells**: Many houses had their own wells, indicating planning for a reliable water supply within the urban environment.

### Public Buildings and Granaries
- **Granaries**: Large granaries found in Mohenjo-Daro were well-planned for storing surplus food, with features such as raised platforms for ventilation and protection from floods.
- **Public Buildings**: The city contained large public buildings, such as the Great Granary and assembly halls, which were centrally located and built to a consistent design, reflecting organized urban planning.

### Citadel
- **Elevated Citadel**: The citadel, a raised and fortified area within the city, housed important administrative and possibly ceremonial structures. Its strategic elevation and layout suggest a planned approach to governance and defense.

### Building Materials
- **Standardized Bricks**: The use of standardized baked bricks for construction across the city indicates a centralized approach to building materials, contributing to the overall planned nature of the urban landscape.

### Zoning
- **Residential and Commercial Zones**: The city was divided into distinct residential and commercial areas, with evidence of specialized production areas (e.g., bead-making workshops), indicating a planned approach to zoning.

These architectural features collectively demonstrate that Mohenjo-Daro was a well-planned architecture.

## Tracking Social Differences
# Burials
- Archeologists use certain strategies to find out whether there were social or economic differences amongst people living within a particular within a particular culture. These include studying burials.
- While Egyptians performed royal burials while in Harappan sites dead were generally laid in pits. 
- Some graves contain pottery and ornaments, perhaps indicating a belief that these could be used in the afterlife.
- Jewellery has been found in burials of both men and women.
- An ornament consisting of three shell rings, a jasper (a kind of semi-precious stone) bead and hundreds of micro-beads was found near the skull of a male.
- In some instances the dead were buried with copper mirrors.
- Harappans did not believe in precious things with dead.

# Luxuries
- The first category include objects of daily use made fairly easily out of ordinary materials such as stone or clay.
- These includes querns, pottery, needles, flesh-rubbers (body scrubbers), etc and are found usually throughout settlements.
- Archaeologists assume objects were luxuries if they are rare or made from costly, non-local materials or with complicated technologies.
- Thus, little pots of faience (a material made of ground sand or silica mixed with color and a gum and then fired) were probably considered precious because they were difficult to make.
- They find that rare objects made of valuable materials are generally concentrated in large settlements like Mohenjodaro and Harappa and are rarely found in the smaller settlements.
- Miniature pots of faience, perhaps used as perfume bottles, are found mostly in Mohenjodaro and Harappa, and there are none from small settlements like Kalibangan.
- Gold was rare. All the golds found at harappan sites was recovered from hoards.

## What are Hoards?
Hoards are objects kept carefully by people, often inside containers such as pots. Such hoards can be of jewellery or metal objects saved for reuse by metalworkers.

# What are the modes of disposal of the dead prevalent at present? To what extent do these represent social differences?
