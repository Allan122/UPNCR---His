# 12th STD - Themes in Indian History

## 1. Topic - Bricks, Bread and Bones (The Harappan Civilisation)

- The Harappan seal is possibly the most distinctive artifact of the Harappan or Indus Valley Civilisation. It was made of a stone called Steatite.
- Seals like this one contain animal motifs and signs from a script that remains undeciphered.
- Yet we know a great deal about the lives of the people who lived in the region from what they left behind - their houses, pots, ornaments, tools, and seals - in other words, from archeological evidence.

# **Terms, Places, Times**
- The Indus Valley Civilisation is also called the Harappan Culture. 
- Archeologists use the term "Culture" for a group of objects, distinctive in style, usually found together within a specific geographical area and period of time.
- In the case of Harappan culture, these distinctive objects include seals, heads, weights, stone blades, and even baked bricks.
- These objects were found in areas as far apart as Afghanistan, Jammu, Baluchistan (Pakistan) and Gujarat.
- Named after Harappa, the first site where this unique culture was discovered, the civilization is dated between 2600 and 1900 BCE.
- There were earlier and later cultures, often called Early Harappan and Late Harappan, in the same area.
- The Harappan Civilisation is sometimes called the Mature Harappan culture to distinguish it from these cultures.

# Important abbreviations
- **BP** stands for **Before Present**
- **BCE** stands for **Before Common Era**
- **CE** stands for **Common Era**

# Settlements of Early and Mature Harappan Cultures
**Sind and Cholistan** (The desert area of Pakistan bordering the Thar Desert.)

# **Only Important**
- There were several archeological cultures in the region prior to the Mature Harappan. These cultures were associated with distinctive pottery, evidence of agriculture and pastoralism, and some crafts.
- Settlements were generally small, and there were virtually no large buildings.
- It appears that there was a break between the Early Harappan and the Harappan Civilisation, evident from large-scale burning at some sites, as well as the abandonment of certain settlements.

 - Harappans ate a wide range of plant and animal products, including fish. Bones of fish and fowl are found.
 - Archeologists have been able to reconstruct dietary practices from finds of charred grains and seeds.
  - Grains found at Harappan sites include wheat, barley, lentil, chickpea, and sesame.
  - Millets are found at sites in Gujarat.
  - Rice is rare.
  - Animal bones found at Harappan sites include those of cattle, sheep, goats, buffalo, and pigs.
  - Studies done by Archeologists or zoo archeologists indicate that these animals were domesticated.
  - Bones of wild species such as boar, deer, and gharial are also found.
  - Not know whether the Harappans hunted these animals themselves or obtained meat from other hunting communities. 

# Agricultural Technologies
- While the prevalence of agriculture is indicated by finds of gains.
- Representation of seals and terracotta sculpture indicate that bull was known and archeologists extrapolate from this that oxen were used for ploughing.
- Terracotta models of the plough have been found at sites in Cholistan and at Banawali (Haryana).
- Archeologists have also found evidence of a ploughed field at Kalibangan (Rajasthan), associated with early Harappan levels.
- The field had two sets of furrows at right angles to each other, suggesting that two different crops were grown together.
- Archeologists have also tried to identify the tools used for harvesting.

# Did the harappans use stone blades set in wooden handles or did they use metal tools?
The Harappan civilization, also known as the Indus Valley Civilization, used both stone tools and metal tools. Archaeological evidence suggests that they employed a variety of stone tools, including stone blades that were likely set in wooden handles. These stone tools were made from materials such as chert and were used for various purposes, including cutting, scraping, and hunting.

In addition to stone tools, the Harappans also used metal tools. They had access to metals like copper and bronze, which they used to create a range of tools and implements. The use of metal tools indicates a relatively advanced level of metallurgical knowledge and technology for their time.

Overall, the Harappan civilization utilized a combination of stone and metal tools to meet their daily needs and to support their sophisticated urban centers.

- Most Harappan sites are located in semi-arid lands, where irrigation was probably required for agriculture.
- Traces of canals have been found at the Harappan site of Shortughai in Afghanistan. Not in Punjab or Sind.
- It is possible that ancient canals silted up long ago.
- It is likely that water drawn from wells was used for irrigation.
- Besides, water reservoir found in Dholavira (Gujarat) may have been used to store water for agriculture.

# What is the evidence used by archeologists to reconstruct dietary practices?
Archaeologists use a variety of evidence to reconstruct the dietary practices of ancient populations, including the following:

1. **Faunal Remains**: Bones, teeth, and shells of animals found at archaeological sites can indicate what types of animals were consumed. Analysis of cut marks, burn marks, and butchery patterns can provide insights into hunting, processing, and cooking practices.

2. **Botanical Remains**: Plant remains such as seeds, nuts, fruits, and grains are often preserved at archaeological sites. These can be recovered through techniques like flotation, where soil samples are agitated in water to separate lighter plant remains from heavier sediments. Pollen analysis and phytolith studies can also provide information on the types of plants that were present and potentially consumed.

3. **Human Remains**: Analysis of human bones and teeth can reveal dietary information through isotopic analysis. For example, stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen in bone collagen can provide insights into the types of plants and animals consumed. Dental wear and the presence of cavities can also give clues about diet.

4. **Residue Analysis**: Chemical analysis of residues found on pottery, tools, or other artifacts can identify traces of foodstuffs that were processed, stored, or cooked. Techniques such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) can detect specific compounds related to different types of food.

5. **Coprolites**: Fossilized human or animal feces, known as coprolites, can provide direct evidence of diet. Analysis of coprolites can reveal undigested food remains, such as seeds, bones, and plant fibers, as well as parasites that might have been present in the food or water supply.

6. **Artifacts**: Tools and artifacts associated with food processing, such as grinding stones, mortars and pestles, and cooking vessels, can offer clues about dietary practices. Wear patterns on these tools can indicate how they were used.

7. **Iconography and Written Records**: In some cases, depictions of food, feasting scenes, or agricultural activities in art, as well as written records such as inscriptions or texts, can provide information about what people ate and how they prepared their food.

8. **Environmental Data**: Reconstruction of ancient environments through pollen analysis, sediment cores, and other paleoenvironmental techniques can provide context for understanding what types of food resources were available in the area.

By combining these various lines of evidence, archaeologists can build a comprehensive picture of the dietary practices of ancient populations.

### Saddle querns are found in considerable numbers and they seem to have been the only means in use for grinding cereals.

# Mohenjodaro A planned urban center
- The most unique feature of the Harappan civilization was the development of Urban centers.
- Mohenjodaro is the most well-known site. The first site to be discovered was Harappa.
- The settlement is divided into two sections, one smaller but higher and the other much larger but lower.
- Archeologists designate these as the Citadel and the lower town respectively.
- Citadel buildings were constructed on mud brick platforms. It was walled and it means that it was seperated from the Lower Town.
