# 12th STD - Themes in Indian History

## 1. Topic - Bricks, Bread and Bones (The Harappan Civilisation)

- The Harappan seal is possibly the most distinctive artifact of the Harappan or Indus Valley Civilisation. It was made of a stone called Steatite.
- Seals like this one contain animal motifs and signs from a script that remains undeciphered.
- Yet we know a great deal about the lives of the people who lived in the region from what they left behind - their houses, pots, ornaments, tools, and seals - in other words, from archeological evidence.

# **Terms, Places, Times**
- The Indus Valley Civilisation is also called the Harappan Culture. 
- Archeologists use the term "Culture" for a group of objects, distinctive in style, usually found together within a specific geographical area and period of time.
- In the case of Harappan culture, these distinctive objects include seals, heads, weights, stone blades, and even baked bricks.
- These objects were found in areas as far apart as Afghanistan, Jammu, Baluchistan (Pakistan) and Gujarat.
- Named after Harappa, the first site where this unique culture was discovered, the civilization is dated between 2600 and 1900 BCE.
- There were earlier and later cultures, often called Early Harappan and Late Harappan, in the same area.
- The Harappan Civilisation is sometimes called the Mature Harappan culture to distinguish it from these cultures.
